# DD2421-Machine-Learning

# Three labs

This course consisted of three assignments revolving around three ML topics:

1) Decision Trees
2) Support Vector Machines
3) Bayesian Learning

Each directory contains the Python implementation and instructions for these.

# Programming Challenge

The programming challenge required us to use machine learning, feature engineering and data cleaning techniques in order to best classify the given data. To achieve the best results, a random forest classifier was implemented. The accuracy achieved on the evaluation set was 64%, which yielded the best achievable grade as shown by the given grade curve below. The instructions:
